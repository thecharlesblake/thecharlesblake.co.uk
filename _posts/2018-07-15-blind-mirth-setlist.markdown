description: An improv games setlist for Blind Mirth
---

For the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe I created a web app designed to help us (Blind
Mirth) pick improv games for our shows based on the different features of each
game. This will hopefully a) stop us from forgetting about games(!), and b)
give us more ballanced shows.

I've now moved the app onto this site (it was previously on the Blind Mirth
site which I think is now defunct). You can now find the app at the following link:

[thecharlesblake.co.uk/improv]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link improv/index.html %})

If you have any suggestions / improvements then let me know!
